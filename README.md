## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React**: Component-based architecture for a responsive and modular UI
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the app with dark/light themes and custom UI components
- **Chart.js & react-chartjs-2**: For interactive data visualizations and trend analysis
- **React Icons**: For stylish icons, including theme toggles

### Backend
- **Express.js**: Handles API routes and serves weather data from OpenWeatherMap
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the weather API
- **CORS**: To handle cross-origin requests between backend and frontend

## Features

### 1. Real-Time Weather Summaries
- Provides current temperature, max/min temperature, and dominant weather condition for multiple cities
- 5-day forecast displayed elegantly in a modal view with independent charts for temperature, humidity, and wind speed

### 2. Interactive Charts with Zoom and Pan
- **Temperature Chart**: Displays average, max, and min temperatures with zoom and pan capabilities
- **Humidity & Wind Speed Chart**: Displays data on independent Y-axes for better readability

### 3. Dark/Light Mode Toggle üåôüåû
- Users can switch between dark and light modes
- The selected theme is persisted in localStorage and applied on reload

### 4. Loader Animation
- A stylish loader animation is shown while data is being fetched from the backend
